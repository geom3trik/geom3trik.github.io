## 

Styling widgets refers to modifying a set of style properties which determine where widgets will be placed within the window as well as how they will visually appear.

There are two types of styling:
 1. Inline Styling - The style properties affect a single widget
 2. Shared Styling - The style properties are shared between multiple widgets
